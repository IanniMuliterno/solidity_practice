# Solidity toy contracts 

Welcome to my toy contracts repository, the intention here is to build some toy contratcs to consolidate my learning. 

## List of contratcs

* Tweet

    A simple contract that allows the user to  input a array of tweets, change tweet length and check timestamp of the tweet among other attributes
   Exercises:  builtin solidity functions and properties, `function`, `variable declarations`, `modifier`,`require`, `struct`, `mapping` and `event`

* Pausable Token

   A contract to further work the skills on `modifiers` and transaction. This contract allows the owner, and only the owner, to pause and unpause the contract. In addition, the owner can transfer a specific amount to another account if the transfer amount <= owners balance.

* Event practice

   A contract that allows user registration and notifies everytime a new user is added.
