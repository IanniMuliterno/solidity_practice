# Solidity toy contracts 

Welcome to my toy contracts repository, the intention here is to build some toy contratcs to consolidate my learning. 

## List of contratcs

* Tweet

    A simple contract that allows the user to  input a array of tweets, change tweet length and check timestamp of the tweet among other attributes
   Exercises:  builtin solidity functions and properties, `function`, `variable declarations`, `modifier`,`require`, `struct` and `mapping`

* Pausable Token: [in progress]

   A contract to further work the skills on `modifiers`
